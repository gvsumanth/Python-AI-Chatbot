# AI Chatbot using Python and Machine Learning

This is a simple AI chatbot built using Python, NLTK for natural language processing, and TensorFlow/Keras for intent classification. The project demonstrates how to train a neural network on predefined intents and interact with users through a command-line interface.

---

## Overview

This chatbot takes user input, predicts the intent behind it using a trained model, and responds accordingly. It uses basic NLP techniques like tokenization and lemmatization, and a neural network classifier built with Keras. The data used for training includes a set of intents defined in a JSON file.

This project was built for learning purposes and showcases the fundamentals of building AI-powered conversational bots.

## Features

- Intent classification using a neural network
- Preprocessing with tokenization and lemmatization (NLTK)
- Interactive command-line interface
- Easy customization with `intents.json`
- Simple and modular code structure

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-project.git
   cd chatbot-project
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download required NLTK data:

   ```bash
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Train the chatbot model:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. Start the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python chat.py
   ```

The chatbot will load the trained model and respond based on user input.

## Customization

You can add or modify the chatbot's behavior by editing the `intents.json` file:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "How are you?"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"]
    }
  ]
}
```

After modifying the intents, retrain the model by running `train.py`.

> **Next step:** Replace `"Your Name"` and the GitHub repo link with your actual details before pushing it to GitHub.

Let me know if you also want a simple Flask web interface or plan to deploy it anywhere (like on Hugging Face, Vercel, or Streamlit).
